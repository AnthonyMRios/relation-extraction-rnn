BACKGROUND : Since the introduction of the first DRUGA inhibitor ( ChEI ) in dgdgdgdg , most clinicians and probably most patients would consider the cholinergic drugs , DRUGB , galantamine and rivastigmine , to be the first line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer 's disease.The drugs have slightly different pharmacological properties , but they all work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine , an important neurotransmitter associated with memory , by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase .
